    <h1><em>About Me!</em></h1>
    <p>
      I'm Erik, a 15-year military veteran, husband, father and aspiring software engineer. I was born in San Diego, CA and moved around a lot due to being part of a military family. After high school, I joined the military completing multiple tours including to Afghanistan and Kuwait. I learned many skills in the military including team-work, leadership, hardwork, but most of all that no matter what stage of life or career you’re in, learning is always fundamentally important and is a lifetime cultivation.  A couple of years ago (2018), I had little to zero experience with programing languages. Since then I have taken courses in Java and Python, most recently completing a Python Data Structure course. I realized the more I learn about coding the more I want to know and so I started the process of attending coding bootcamp, offered by Skill Distillery, which begins January 11, 2021. This course will give me the tools I need to expand into the industry and really see what I can do as a software engineer. I’m looking forward to the challenge of this coding bootcamp that focuses on Java as the primary language. I will be seeking employment in the industry immediately following completion of the coding bootcamp. Currently, I’m only two courses away from completing my A.S. degree,  but decided to put that on hold to focus on my programming. I plan to finish up my associates after bootcamp and also have plans to complete my B.S. degree shortly there after to further the education I receive from the Skill Distillery.
