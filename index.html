      December 30, 2020
      <br><br>
      My name is Erik. This is my first blog, created using HTML, CSS;
      however my plan is to continue to update it throughout my coding
      journey. In traditional coding fashion, the title of this first
      blog entry is “Hello World!”

    </strong></p>
    <p>

      The beginning of my coding journey started sometime in 2014. It was the first time I dabbled in anything program related but didn’t think of it for a career. My aspirations were instead to be a physicist… and then I was told… “umm, you don’t seem to want to me a physics teacher, you get more excited coding.”
<br>
Coding? As a career? I’d never thought of that. I won’t bore you with all the self reflection that took a couple of years, but needless to say, I realized coding was something I was passionate about and I wanted a career, not a job, and I wanted a career that I was passionate about and one I would enjoy. I ended up taking a few classes in community college and the next thing you know, here I am.
Here, creating a blog, that I hope you read, to share my journey with learning coding through this coding Bootcamp offered by Skill Distillery.
<br>
Why Skill Distillery you ask? You might get a long answer full of twists and curves, but I’ll trying to be concise for you...
<br>
After I decided to take on the challenge of participating in a coding bootcamp, I researched for months <and came up a with a list of> some of the best bootcamps. But,  many of them seemed to be cookie cutter versions of each other. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure these bootcamps are great and provide great instruction, but I wanted something more. I was looking for a bootcamp that would give me the tools to stand out in a crowd of other bootcamp coding graduates. I was conducting research on Veteran Affairs (VA) approved bootcamps when I came across the VET TEC program and Skill Distillery. Skill Distillery stood out like a shining beacon (the way I hope to stand out). Other bootcamps seem to focus more on the basic stack developmental courses whereas SD focuses on the highly coveted and more technical language that is JAVA.
<br>
I saw this bootcamp as one that would teach me skills in a technical program that has not only lasted through rapid changes in the industry but is required for many of the jobs that I have been looking at. This bootcamp will help set me up for success in this highly competitive tech industry.
<br>
This also seemed like the best time to register and participate in the bootcamp. Due to COVID, Skill Distillery moved to an online format. This allows me an opportunity to learn from a company I respect while being able to stay with my family in the Chicagoland area. With everything falling into place and my passion for coding growing with every community college class I had taken, I knew this would be the coding bootcamp for me.
<br>
I decided to submit my application. I had to. I knew I would “what if” myself, if I hadn’t. Thankfully, after submitting my application, I was invited to take the coding exam. Man, was I nervous about that, but I studied for it, completed it and…. I passed it!! I though the coding exam was hard, but was I wrong. That was nothing compared to what came next.
<br>
After the coding exam submission, I was given the opportunity to interview with the company. That was one of the more nerve wrecking interviews ever… more than for a job, where I’m expecting this course to lead me. I want this so bad. I was so nervous for my interview - and then my nervousness ratched up yet another notch cause I ended up in the hospital the day of the interview.
<br>
I’ll share more about my interview in the next blog entry. Keep reading :-)
<br>
p.s. if you are a veteran and looking to build your skills and your resume, check out the VET TEC program I mentioned above. You can access it here: https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/FGIB/VetTecTrainingProviders.asp, and feel free to leave me a comment, question or dm me and I’ll be happy to share my reserach or opinions with you.
